# CrusadersCharacters
A Server-Sided 1.7.10 Characters mod for DBC!
This is an Open-Source project, which means taking code from this and using it
for yourself is allowed. I only ask you credit me!

This must only be installed on a server. It won't work client-side!
The different Characters store and change DBC Data, Inventory, and EnderChest.

The config file allows you to change the Chat Prefix and add a TP Multiplier!
 
To start, run (/character [unlock] [2-5] Optional: [player]) Character 1 is unlocked by default.
To run this command, you need to be OP or run it from console. 
You can make a CustomNPC run this command, or maybe RPGItems of some sort.
 
To create Characters, run (/character [create] [2-5]) Character 1 is created by default.
 
To switch Characters, run (/character [select] [1-5]) Character 1 is selected by default.
 
To show Character info, run (/character [info] Optional: [player])
This will tell the selected Character, how many are unlocked, and how many are created.
